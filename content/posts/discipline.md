On “5 Nov 2012”, I took a revolutionary step in my life. I set myself up to become a disciplined man. Back then and until very recently, “Immanuel Kant” was ~~and still is~~ my role model in life. A‌‌ disciplined lifestyle was completely new to me, and contrary to me since my childhood. Whenever I needed to be disciplined, I was on a run from doing the hard work.

But on “5 Nov 2012”, for an unknown reason, I decided to change that. Honestly, there were neither a predetermined planning nor a motivational video or book as a root cause, but there were some very long and painful contemplations that I kept in my mind for decades (I believe I started to feel the need of being disciplined since 4th grade, or when I was 10 years old kid) that pushed me to change.

**For the next 4 months, I only ate the same lunch (except a few occasions), took a walk between 13:45 and 14:30, wrote a heck of code, read multiple technical books on a regular basis, and detoxed my brain from most of the poisons and pains that I fed myself during all these years.** [Probably reading German philosophers in my early youth was not a good idea after all].

It was like doing strength training, and hating it. But then I‌ started to see the results and effects on my confidence and personality. In a few weeks, I‌ even started to enjoy the process. I‌ respected myself more and more, and even my viewpoint to the universe got more positive [1].

Unfortunately, it continued for only 4 months, and I don’t remember why I did not continue that process either. Maybe because I was punishing myself too hard for not being a disciplined person since childhood, or maybe I‌ got pre-mature satisfaction from seeing the progress and improvements. It’s not important in this stage, as I‌ got the ideas from this critical period of my life and internalized the results.

Looking back at my life, I can say with high confidence that those four months were one of the most memorable and fruitful times in my life.

I‌ implemented what Immanuel Kant said himself:

Man must be disciplined, for he is by nature raw and wild…

Today is “28 Feb 2024”, and I look at those days with honor and respect. If I die tomorrow, and they ask me about the accomplishments of my life, I will emphasize that four months period and having such a good-hearted and hardworking son, Ryan…
